# Git and github
All data and code is managed using a the **version control system** git with using github as a platform. A great introduction about the advantages of git and github in the bioinformatics can be found in [Perez-Riverol2019](./literature/git/Perez-Riverol2019.pdf).  

Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. It allows multiple people to work cooperatively to work on a project. For a nice introduction read [getting started - about version control](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control) and [getting started - what is git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-What-is-Git%3F).

An overview over online resources can be found at https://try.github.io/. We recommend to do the following short online course giving an overview in git commands such as `branch`, `add`, `commit`, `merge`: Online course: https://learngitbranching.js.org/ 

A cheat sheet of the most important git commands can be found here: https://training.github.com/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet.pdf

## Most important git commands
Only a handful commands are used to work with git. 
### Initial setup
After git installation you should first setup your environment via
```
git config --global user.name "[name]" 
```
Sets the name you want attached to your commit transactions
```
git config --global user.email "[email address]"
```
Sets the email you want attached to your commit transactions

```
git config --global color.ui auto
```
Enables helpful colorization of command line output
