# Git and github

![Git and github](./resources/git/git_github.png)

All data and code is managed using a the **version control system** git with using github as a platform. A great introduction about the advantages of git and github in the bioinformatics can be found in [Perez-Riverol2019](resources/git/Perez-Riverol2019.pdf).  

Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. It allows multiple people to work cooperatively to work on a project. For a nice introduction read [getting started - about version control](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control) and [getting started - what is git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-What-is-Git%3F).

An overview over online resources can be found at https://try.github.io/. We recommend to do the following short online course giving an overview in git commands such as `branch`, `add`, `commit`, `merge`: Online course: https://learngitbranching.js.org/ 

## Most important git commands
Only a handful commands are used to work with git. A cheat sheet of the most important git commands can be found here: [github-git-cheat-sheet](./resources/git/github-git-cheat-sheet.pdf)
 
### Initial setup
After git installation you should first setup your environment.

Set the name you want attached to your commit transactions
```
git config --global user.name "[name]" 
```
Set the email you want attached to your commit transactions
```
git config --global user.email "[email address]"
```
Enable helpful colorization of command line output
```
git config --global color.ui auto
```

### Working with a repository
![git and github workflow](./resources/git/git-and-github-workflow.png)


To work with a project first you have to clone the repository, i.e., getting a local copy.

Clone (download) a repository that already exists on GitHub, including all of the files, branches, and commits
```
git clone [url]
```

Next make sure you work on the right branch, i.e., you have to switch the branch. 
Switch to the specified branch and updates the working directory
```
git checkout [branch-name]
```

After making changes to files, these have to be added and commited.
Snapshot the file in preparation for versioning.
```
git add [file]
```
Record file snapshots permanently in version history
```
git commit -m "[descriptive message]"
```

## Github

Next step is to complete the free online course on GitHub (after you created an account on https://github.com). The course is available from
https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/introduction-to-github

You will learn 
- What is GitHub?
- How does one use GitHub?
- What are issues and pull requests?
- How do you create a branch and a commit?
- How do you use GitHub Pages?

And when you're done you'll be able to:

- Communicate in issues
- Manage notifications
- Create branches
- Make commits
- Introduce changes with pull requests
- Deploy a web page to GitHub pages
