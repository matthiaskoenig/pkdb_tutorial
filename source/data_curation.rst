Data curation
=============
An important part of building a pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic model is curation of experimental and clinical data. These data is used for model parametrization and model validation.  

Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics data
------------------------------------------
See the curation information in the
`curation tutorial
<https://github.com/matthiaskoenig/pkdb_data/blob/develop/CURATION.md>`_.

Kinetic parameters
------------------
Kinetic parameters are important for building the tissue models of metabolism which are integrated into the whole-body models.
