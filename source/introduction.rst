Introduction
============
This document provides a high level overview into resources and tools used to build physiological-based pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamcis (PK/PD) models in the `KÃ¶nig group

Within this tutorial the resources and information will be provided to build a PK/PD for a given drug or substance. See the following introductory talk giving an overview of basic concepts and the work in our group :download:`Physiological based pharmacokinetics models for analysis of liver function </resources/introduction/Koenig2020_pk-tutorial.pdf>`.

A good introduction to the basic concepts in physiologically based pharmacokinetic modeling in drug discovery and development can be found in :download:`Jones2013 </resources/introduction/Jones2013.pdf>`.


Example projects
----------------
A project such as a bachelor thesis or an internship project focuses on the modelling of a single drug or substance. Within the project an existing template of a physiological whole-body model is adapted for the respective substance. This includes building of tissue specific models for the organs of relevance (often liver and kidneys) and applying the resulting model to a biological question.

Multiple such projects have been finished, for instance

- Computational modelling of simvastatin - Effects on HMG-CoA reductase activity and cholesterol levels :download:`Bartsch2020 </resources/introduction/Thesis_Bartsch2020.pdf>`.
- Computational modelling of midazolam clearance - Effect of inhibitors and inducers :download:`Duport2020 </resources/introduction/Thesis_Duport2020.pdf>`.
