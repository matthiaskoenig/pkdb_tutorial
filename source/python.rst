Python
======
Most of the code and scripts used in PK/PD modeling are in Python. Basic programming skills in python are required.

Python tutorial
---------------
Good interactive python tutorials can be found online. For instance at `https://www.learnpython.org/ <https://www.learnpython.org/>`_.

An overview of tutorials can be found here `https://digitaldefynd.com/best-free-python-tutorials/ <https://digitaldefynd.com/best-free-python-tutorials/>`_.

As a minimum requirement, the following concepts are required

- Variables and Types
- Lists
- Basic Operators
- String Formatting
- Basic String Operations
- Conditions
- Loops
- Functions
- Classes and Objects
- Dictionaries
- Modules and Packages

Code editor
------------
An integrated development environment (IDE) should be used to write code. This provides direct feedback and nice features such as code-completion.
We recommend using `PyCharm <https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/>`_ as an integrated development environment.
A free professional license is available for academics.

Virtual environments
--------------------
All code should be run in virtual environments. A good solution is `conda <https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/>`_
Conda is an open source package management system and environment management system that runs on Windows, macOS and Linux. Conda quickly installs, runs and updates packages and their dependencies. Conda easily creates, saves, loads and switches between environments on your local computer. See the `getting started guide <https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/getting-started.html#>`_ for more information.
